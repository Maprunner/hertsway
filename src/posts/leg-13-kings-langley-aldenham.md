It was an early start since we knew we had a long leg ahead and I needed to be back for a meeting. 3ºC when we left home had crept up to 5ºC as we set out, but it was still cold enough for each of us to put an extra layer on. But the sun was shining from a blue sky, at least over Kings Langley, and we were soon running up Egg Farm Lane to reach the wind turbine first spotted n the previous leg.

The headquarters of Renewable Energy Systems are at [Beaufort Court](http://www.beaufortcourt.com/) in what used to be the Ovaltine Egg Farm. The site now has a 36m tall 225kW wind turbine, along with fields full of elephant grass and some rather hidden solar panels. It lies high above Kings Langley, and is the landmark on the M25 that means we are nearly back in St Albans. The low sun cast a shadow of the rotating turbine blades on the fields. Beyond lay the old Ovaltine Factory where the eggs used to go, and then the canal and railway ran up the Gade Valley to Hemel Hempstead where yet again the Kodak Building dominated the skyline.

Helen decided that the views were good enough that she could Whatsapp James to say we were setting out on the latest leg, and we then continued the climb up to a footbridge over the M25. The sign on the gantry was advising essential travel and a lot of people clearly had essential business.

The motorway had soon disappeared in a cutting beyond the trees and we set off around the edge of the fields above Abbots Langley. This was slightly complicated by the fact that Helen's OS map showed the Hertfordshire Way running the other side of the motorway for another two kilometres or so before crossing on a different footbridge. That original route obviously changed at some point but we managed to spot enough signs to find our way to where the old and new routes joined.

From the group of old houses around the top of the hill we started dropping into open fields again with views to the distant Shenley ridge and its old water tower. That will reappear at the end of the next leg, but today it did seem a long way away. The other striking things was quite how much undulating open space there was between St Albans off to our left and Watford to our right.

We came to a notice showing that the path had been diverted round a field. This took us up past another large farmhouse with a

We passed Parmiters School,which turns out to be very large and looked like it might be worth mapping for an orienteering sprint race at some point. Next to it is Watford Crematorium, and then we took the underpass under the

After snacks on a bench on the village green we took the path past the golf course and through a large area of very brambly woodland that was also very full of walkers. The small road at the bottom that took us under the M1 and the A41 was called Otterspool Lane which presumably is a historical reference since I certainly wasn't expecting to see an otter in the River Colne. There was a nasty section of road with no pavement, with another pill box appearing behind the hedge, and then we crossed the River Colne and came to the entrance to Topgolf.

Helen checked the map to work out exactly how to get through Watford and I crossed the road to look at the rover. And at that point a blue flash appeared half a second later had disappeared again round the bend in the river. "Kingfisher" I yelled but it had gone and Helen was suitably annoyed to have missed it.

We followed the Colne for quite a way along the edge of Watford and past a large area of somewhat neglected allotments. The river was a bit of a surprise with deep and clear sections of chalk stream complete with extensive watercress. Helen spent this whole section scanning every tree for another kingfisher but nothing appeared. Instead the path got steadily muddier and the watercress turned into thicker and thicker stinging nettles.

We then set off up the hill through the back streets of Watford. The route went under the West Coast Main Line, just avoiding Watford Junction station, and we then took in a selection of the highlights of central Watford. St John's Church, the Palace Theatre, the YMCA, the High Street full of Christmas decorations, expensive food stalls and students, an illuminated Watford sign, Watford Town Hall and Watford Colosseum. The surprising thing was how close all of this was to the rivers and open countryside that we had arrived through.

And that countryside started again as we got the top of [Cassiobury Park](https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#294). This was another place that was very busy with people walking, running and cycling in huge numbers. The long steady drop to the canal took us through parkland that is gradually getting more vegetated. I was still trying to get a proper photo of a parakeet and this is where they should have been, but despite hearing quite a few I never got a very good view of one.

A large group of workers was laying a new path along the edge of the miniature railway, and then it was over the River Gade, past the waterfall (all one metre of it) and over a bridge to the canal towpath complete with a barge selling coffee and tea. From here all we had to do was turn right and follow the water back to the car.
