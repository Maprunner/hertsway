After a short drive passing much of what we would later run through, we parked next to the church at Bovingdon. There was a lot of blue sky with light cloud but it had got noticeably colder. We set off through the churchyard again but this time turned left at the well in the High Street and passed Anvil Close and Farriers Close hinting at a previous local industry. There was slight confusion when a parked van blocked the path out of the housing estate, but soon we were into open fields. Extensive greenhouses lay off to the right and a large radar dome appeared in the distance behind them. A first red kite of the day put in an appearance. Pleasant enough but nothing special. And so it proved for the rest of the day

I remarked that the holly hedges were quite thick and well-tended all along the lane. Helen pointed out that might be why it was called Holly Hedges Lane

Woods leading to Chipperfield.

Somebody had put in a lot of time and effort to build a series of double fences around the fields but it was not clear what these fences were intended to separate from what. muddy path along hedge that wasn't needed.

A field full of six-inch stalks of what used to be sweetcorn led us to the bridge over the A41. first sight of Watford, red kites, RES windmill, M25 viaduct

Kings Langley, Canal

Three mute swans paddled past and Helen spotted an orange leg ring on one of them. 4BED turns out to have been ringed at Tringford Reservoir just north of Tring in May 2009 and since then has been reported at various places along the canal between Tring and Watford. Most recently it had been seen at Croxley Common Moor earlier this month and in Hemel Hempstead in July.

A red kite flew over the car as we were getting changed, as is becoming traditional. And finally we were treated to a flock of thirteen red kites circling over the east of the village as we drove home.
