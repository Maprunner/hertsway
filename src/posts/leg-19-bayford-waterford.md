We'd already seen three buzzards, a red kite and a muntjac by the time we got to Bayford which seemed like a good start for the first leg of the year. We did a quick lap of the village before finally deciding to park at the church.

After a few more team photos by the village sign we set off north through the fields along the edge of the railway towards Hertford. We found the first few pine trees in the woods behind Bayfordbury Mansion but had to cross the footbridge before reaching the [Pinetum](http://www.clintonbakerpinetum.org.uk/pinetum.html).

We had made it to the edge of Hertford and now had a long road run through houses on the way down to the centre of the town. The first major sight we came to was [All Saints's Church](https://www.allsaintshertford.org/church.php). This has a large and overgrown graveyard, but the church itself was definitely not like any of the over churches we had seen so far. This turns out to be because the original church burnt down in 1891 and this is a Victorian replacement designed by a Lancastrian architect using stone from Runcorn.

It sits right next to the very unattractive A414 dual carriageway, but after crossing via the underpass we were instantly in amongst the historic buildings of old Hertford. We passed the decorative white plasterwork on the outside of the Salisbury Arms Hotel (with a date of 1570 highlighted in black) and came to the War Memorial in the middle of Parliament Square. We'll be back again since this is also the end of the alternative loop from Cuffley to Hertford that we will be doing next.

The scenery kept coming as we passed the Hertford Theatre complete with a sculpture commemorating the synod in 673, found a life-size statue of Samuel Stone who founded the town of Hartford, Connecticut, crossed the River Lea with a view across to Hertford castle, and ran past a memorial to the Boer War. Then is was back to housing as we ran down Port Vale towards Bengeo.

A theme then emerged as we ran down Molewood Road past Molewood House and Molewood Lodge and a big new house being built at High Molewood before going under the railway to reach Great Molewood, a road leading into Great Mole Wood. The only thing we didn't see was a mole or even any evidence of one.

By now we had reached the open field of Waterford Marsh and had a very pleasant stretch along the banks of the River Beane. The weeds were freshly cut and almost the first thing that appeared was a grey wagtail. This was the second I had seen in two days, since one had also turned up o the River Ver the day before. Wrens were making a lot of noise all along the river and two red kites flew overhead. At the far end we could see St Michael and All Angels Church, Waterford, on the hill up to the left before getting to Vicarage Road and the end of today's section.

We set off up the road and over the railway to get to Waterford Heath Nature Reserve which has a convenient car park for next time we are here. The Heath was reasonably busy with people walking in all directions. The steady climb up to the top of the hill passed through a large field full of teasels, and we then had a brief stop to admire the view north over the heath and west across to the large house on the Goldings estate.

There was then a muddy path down through Great Mole Wood (still no moles in sight) before we went under the railway through a puddle too big to avoid and got back to the river.

This is another part of Hertfordshire with a limited path network so we had to settle for a long road run to get across to Panshanger. Sign for Goldings farm. Cemetery. New housing estate at corner of [Panshanger Park](https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#320).

The path led through the car park where parkrun would start every Saturday in normal times. The last time it was run here was March 14th when 255 runners took part. It now looks like there will be a gap of at least a year until it happens again. Panshanger was also meant to be the Hertfordshire Orienteers April 2020 Saturday Series so that was one of the first events cancelled.

The car park was full and everywhere was busy with people out walking in what was now bright sunshine. We went through the parkrun finish and down towards the marshes and reed beds. The noticeboards announced the dragonflies and damselflies that could be seen but it wasn't quite the right time of year for that. Down to lakes and reed beds. Snacks looking for dragonflies.

Osprey Lake. Distant heron in tree. Selection of mallard, tufted duck, moorhen and coot.

Cross River Mimram. Under A414 to Hertingfordbury. Heron on fence post.

Cross River Lea just east of junction with River Mimram.
