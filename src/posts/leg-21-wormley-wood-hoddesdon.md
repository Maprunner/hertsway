This needed to be a quick leg since Helen needed to be back by one o'clock for a meeting. Things started badly with internet problems meaning I struggled to send some work emails so we were already late when we left home. There was then another delay whilst we scraped ice of the car. And then we discovered a police van blocking the road at Tylers Causeway.

I speculated that it was a crash caused by ice on the steep hill ahead. Whatever it was we had to turn round and take the scenic route places we had passed on Leg 18 including Cucumber Lane, Little Berkhamsted and Stratton's Tower. But it all added an extra fifteen minutes.

It was still very cold as we set off but with bright sunshine and a blue sky. The cold had at least frozen most of the mud and puddles and made them slightly easier to run over. We had soon made it to the main part of Broxbourne Wood and I pulled out my map from an event in January 1982 that was still reasonably accurate.

The path along Spital Brook was suitably muddy . The sunshine was enough to encourage bird song and blue tits, great tits, chaffinches, robins and redwings. A buzzard flew off through the trees as we approached but this would finally be the leg where we wouldn't see a red kite. A moated enclosure.

As we emerged on the track at the far end of the woods a post van was making its way down the isolated road to the farm at the far end. This farm turned out to have its own array of solar panels carefully screened from view of the farmhouse by a large clump of bamboo and a eucalyptus tree.

At the bottom of the field we came to the A10 for the first time, but followed it south rather than crossing at the underpass. The path went past large patches of gorse.

We crossed the A10 and after a short detour after missing the path we set off across the [Lucy Warren Open Space](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/woods/lucy-warren-open-space/) around the edge of Broxbourne. After a short stretch on roads we got to [Top Field Cozens Grove](https://ex.broxbourne.gov.uk/leisure-parks-and-green-spaces/top-field-cozens-grove)

At the bottom of the wood the path was blocked with a large metal fence and notices advised of a diversion whilst yet more building work went on at Broxbourne School. The diversion took us along the edge of the golf course, across the New River and then back along a main road, but more importantly added an extra kilometre and ten minutes to our day.

But eventually we dropped down onto the path along the New River

Big houses

Church

Birds

We got one step closer to seeing a fox when a large dead one turned up on the path.

The New River separates the houses if Broxbourne to the west from the railway to the east and beyond that the River Lea and . The multi-storey car park next to Broxbourne station had a scattering of cars on the ground level but was otherwise empty. A very large new car park further north was completely empty and had obviously been built to meet demand that may not exist for a very long time yet.

Old pumping station.

The end point today was an iron footbridge on the New River. Looking at the photos later I made out the maker's mark which showed the bridge had been made in 1863 by .

We crossed the bridge and found a way through a supermarket car park to emerge in Hoddesdon town centre.

The intention was to break up the road route back to the A10 by picking up a footpath behind the houses. This cost us another five minutes since the path was closed and yet another hosing estate was going up. Instead we had to settle for the road which took us past High Leigh and then back over the A10.

There were various options to get back through Broxbourne but with time getting tight we settled for pretty much the shortest. We saved a few minutes by having snacks on the move, although it was no more than half a hot cross bun each since stocks had run out. We ploughed on through the mud in Broxbourne Wood and then headed down Ermine Street. This turned out to go past Danemead Scout Camp where Helen and Peter had stayed out on a scout camp.

We finally emerged at the back of Paradise Wildlife Park . On the other sid of teh road ws the house with a large enclosure of wolves. Finally the path took us past the dinosaur park with two large dinosaurs looming over the fence in the sunshine.

That got us back to the car but time was still tight. We guessed that whatever had caused the road closure at Tylers Causeway would be cleared by now. This turned out to be correct, an the probable cause of the closure also appeared when we passed a very large crane sticking out into the road as it lifted steelwork for a new house. So we finally arrived home to give Helen ten minutes for a shower before her meeting started.

No red kite.
