This was a bit of an unplanned day, but a combination of an early finish to my meeting and a lot more sunshine than predicted meant that we decided to set off. The car park by the war memorial was almost full with dog and child walkers but we found a space and headed down the path we had come up on Sunday. Driving there we had agreed that this was yet another strange leg, with a downhill stretch into Berkhamsted, a long straight section along a canal and then another long straight section uphill at right angles to the canal to get to Bovingdon. It didn't seem particularly inspiring.

Downhill through the woods was easy, and the sound of a train showed that we were getting close to the West Coast Main Line. The path headed down an open valley towards what is known as known as Kitchener's Field on the edge of Berkhamsted. A large bird on an overhead wire next to the edge caught my eye and turned out to be a kestrel. A flock of meadow pipits then decided to land on the wires next to the kestrel, and two yellowhammers high up in the adjacent tree glinted bright yellow in the sunshine. As an added bonus a stonechat turned up and sat just a few metres away in the hedge. That was a pretty good collection of birds for standing in one place for about two minutes.

Pressing on we were soon at [Berkhamsted castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/berkhamsted-castle/). This was originally an 11th Century motte-and-bailey (which is a phrase I probably haven't used since O-Level history ended in 1979), and now consists of a few stone remnants spread over a small hill surrounded by a mainly dry ditch which could just about be imagined as a moat.

At the next lock we discovered a worker in a hi-vis jacket blocking the path and the sound of a chainsaw coming from the trees just off to the right. We waited patiently and a large tree eventually fell completely blocking the towpath. It was not obvious that that was exactly where they had intended it to fall, but after the two workers had removed some of the bigger branches we managed to scramble through and leave them to sorting out the mess. They had obviously been quite busy since the next few hundred yards of towpath were littered with small branches that they had cut back.

I spotted a heron at the far end of a small lake but it was too far away to get a good photo. And then a bright white shape appeared just a few metres away through the trees on a fence. It was a little egret which walked slowly along the fence showing off its bright yellow feet. It had three rings on its legs, with an orange "L" on the left leg and a black "9" and plain metal ring on the right. When we got home I submitted the details to the [Southern Colour Ringing Group](http://www.southern-colour-ringing-group.org.uk/index.php) website and we now know that this was [little egret GY02522](http://www.southern-colour-ringing-group.org.uk/index.php/recoveries/little-egret/bird/GBT-GY02522). It was ringed as a nestling in May this year at Netherhall in Essex which is in the Lea Valley just east of Hoddesdon. We will pass quite close later on our trip around Hertfordshire.

We were now getting towards the end of the canal section. A first red kite of the day flew over, a large flock of Canada geese paddled slowly along and we reached the road bridge where we needed to turn off. All that had been missing was a flash of blue as a kingfisher sped past, so we had to settle for the picture of one on the sign outside Kingfisher Farm. A short section of main road was made more entertaining by the speed sign that was suffering a flat battery despite the solar panel on top. It had enough power left to cycle through various error messages but had clearly given up on displaying anything sensible. Unless "Low bat" was an attempt to report a wildlife sighting.

There had been so much to look at so far that we had only managed six kilometres in the first hour, despite the fact that it had all been downhill. The rest of the way to Bovingdon was going to be all uphill. There was a steady climb up to the bridge over the A41 and then on through another large and empty golf course. We were soon getting extensive views across the Bulbourne Valley from Berkhamsted to the west all the way around to Hemel Hempstead to the east. I was hoping we might even be able to see the Bridgewater Monument again but it was just too far away and too low, so we settled with trying to work out what the large copper-topped tower with what looked like a hole in it was that we could see towards Berkhamsted,

The golf course eventually ended and we set off down a driveway lined with very large houses. These ended to be replaced with fields, woodland and some very nice farms along the correctly named Stoney Lane which then led us to St Lawrence Church, Bovingdon. St Lawrence seems to be surprisingly popular in Hertfordshire and this was at least his fourth church we had passed so far since setting out from Royston. This particular one ticked all the standard boxes with a neat and tidy churchyard (which may or may not be the second largest in Hertfordshire but certainly looked big), trimmed yew trees, gravestones of various ages, and a church building with flint, flint and more flint. For variety the builders had thrown in a few lumps of puddingstone as well. We had a short stop on the bench by the west door during which time it started to rain. This became heavy enough for us to decide to put on coats before setting off on the way back to the car.

Prison, rainbow, too hot, take off coats

Red kite, Bovingdon VOR

Red kites very low

Coming out onto the road I noticed the the footpath signs had changed. We had just entered Buckinghamshire, where we stayed for about a kilometre. Buckinghamshire has even more red kites than Hertfordshire and were were treated to a non-stop display from them flying backwards and forwards low across the road. Cross field, through woods

Under A41. Low. Lighting, horse mounting block.

School playing fields

Through town. Lots of school children

Canal, station, castle

Optimistically I took out the binoculars as we started running up the hedge that had been full of bird life in the sunshine three hours earlier. This time it revealed nothing at all.

Climb to golf course again: same as last time but don't need to go all the way to GG

Kites flying over car park.

Starts raining.
