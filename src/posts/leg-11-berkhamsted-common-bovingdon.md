This was a bit of an unplanned day, but a combination of an early finish to my meeting and a lot more sunshine than predicted meant that we decided to set off. The car park by the war memorial was almost full with dog and child walkers but we found a space and headed down the path we had come up on Sunday. Driving there we had agreed that this was yet another strange leg, with a downhill stretch into Berkhamsted, a long straight section along a canal and then another long straight section uphill at right angles to the canal to get to Bovingdon. It didn't seem particularly inspiring.

Downhill through the woods was easy, and the sound of a train showed that we were getting close to the West Coast Main Line. The path headed down an open valley towards what is known as known as Kitchener's Field on the edge of Berkhamsted. A large bird on an overhead wire next to the edge caught my eye and turned out to be a kestrel. A flock of meadow pipits then decided to land on the wires next to the kestrel, and two birds high up in the adjacent tree were yellowhammers. Just as an added bonus a stonechat turned up and sat just a few metres away in the hedge.

Pressing on we were soon at [Berkhamsted castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/berkhamsted-castle/). This was originally an 11th Century motte-and-bailey (which is a phrase I probably haven't written since O-Level history in 1979), and now consists of a few stone remnants spread over a small hill surrounded by a mainly dry ditch which could just about be imagined as a moat.

At the next lock we discovered a worker in a hi-vis jacket blocking the path and the sound of a chainsaw coming from the trees just off to the right. We waited patiently and a large tree eventually fell completely blocking the towpath. It was not obvious that that was exactly where they had intended it to fall, but after the two workers had removed some of the bigger branches we managed to scramble through and leave them to sorting out the mess. They had obviously been quite busy since the next few hundred yards of towpath were littered with small branches that they had cut back.

I spotted a heron at the far end of a small lake but it was too far away to get a good photo. A bright white shape appeared just a few metres away through the trees on a fence It was a little egret which walked slowly along the fence showing off its bright yellow feet. It had three rings on its legs, with an orange "L" on the left leg and a black "9" and plain metal ring on the right. When we got home I submitted the details to the [Southern Colour Ringing Group](http://www.southern-colour-ringing-group.org.uk/index.php) website and we now know that this was [little egret GY02522](http://www.southern-colour-ringing-group.org.uk/index.php/recoveries/little-egret/bird/GBT-GY02522). It was ringed as a nestling in May this year at Netherhall in Essex which is in the Lea Valley just east of Hoddesdon. We will pass quite close later on our trip around Hertfordshire.

We were now getting towards he end of the canal section. A first red kite of the day flew over, and then we found a large flock of Canada geese paddling slowly along. Canada geese,
