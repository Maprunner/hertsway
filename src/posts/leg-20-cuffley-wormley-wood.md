Helen's exotic trips to Bushey, Elstree and Stevenage to volunteer at vaccine centres meant that we needed to fill up with petrol at the Savacentre on the way to Cuffley. This was also a convenient place to stock up with snacks since the mince pies have finally run out.

That then meant a trip around the M25 and Helen spotted a fox as we came off at Junction 24. That started a long debate about whether we could count that as something we had seen on the Hertfordshire Way. We then got to a set of roadworks with traffic lights which turned out to be stuck on red at both ends, but luckily people worked it out quite quickly and just drove through.

We parked at Cuffley Football Club which we had passed in the fog on Leg 17. I could now see right across the adjacent file but there was no sign of the red-legged partirdges that had been hiding in the fog the last time we were here.

The track down to the railway was as muddy as expected, but somebody had still managed to drive most of the way down it before abandoning a car in deep mud in a field entrance. After crossing under the railway we turned right to start the eastern loop to Hertford. The missing railway viaduct that had been hidden by the fog previously was now visible and provided early interest on what would turn out to be a somewhat dull day.

Northaw Brook flows under the viaduct and we followed it for a while until it joined Cuffley Brook. A red kite flew overhead but the brown splodge in the far corner of the field turned out on closer inspection to be a large pheasant rather than a small muntjac. At least the path was reasonable, and a lot of locals were out to enjoy the sunshine.

At a crossroads we turned left and headed up the hill on what was an old surfaced road. Redwings and fieldfares flew out of the hedges as we approached and another red kite showed up.

We had now reached Goffs Oak which turns out to have few attractions. The Goffs Oak tree (a replacement oak tree planted in 1950 for the alleged eponymous oak tree) stands in a fenced enclosure with a memorial stone outside of the Goffs Oak pub. Nothing else sticks in the memory or was worthy of a photo.

The paths and fields on the way down towards started getting seriously wet and muddy. A kestrel provided a short distraction as we splashed down through the puddles before a short run along the wonderfully names Bread and Cheese Lane.

The final drop down to Turnford Brook took us past a large building site where several very big houses were being fitted in a very small space, even if they did have splendid view down the valley.

Crossing the brook took us into the start of a large section of ancient woodland in [Broxbourne Woods National Nature Reserve](https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/media-library/documents/environment-and-planning/countryside-management-service-%E2%80%93-places-to-visit/places-to-visit/broxbourne-woods/broxbourne-woods-walkers-guide.pdf). Today we would pass through Derry's Wood,Wormley Wood and Bencroft Wood which were already very familiar since this is a mapped orienteering area.

The mandatory photo stop on this leg is the [coal post](https://www.northmymmshistory.uk/2018/01/south-hertfordshires-coal-posts.html) in the middle of the wood. This marks a place for the collection of duties on coal and wine being taken to London. There are several scattered across Hertfordshire but this is the first one we had passed.

We continued on through the wonderful runnable undulating open oak and hornbeam woodlands. Wormleybury Brook at the bottom of the valley was full of small children splashing along it, and we then headed along the edge of the woods past a large newly cleared area before reaching the central track. In November 2010 this had been the finish for the [British Schools Orienteering Championships](<(https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#56)>) that Helen organised and I planned. It should have been the British Schools Orienteering Championships in 2020 as well but that event was unsurprisingly cancelled.

West End Road was littered with parked cars that clearly didn't fit in the normal car parks and reflected the large number of people out walking. One hundred metres up he road and we reached White Stubbs Lane and the end of today's leg. There are limited options to get back to Cuffley and in the end we decided to take in a large block of woodland at Thunderfield Grove that neither of us had been to before, and then another visit to the outskirts of Goffs Oak.

There was slight confusion as we tried to work out how to get Woodman and Olive

Thunderfield Grove itself turned out to be pretty much as expected with a selection of brambles and coppice.although it did also have a section of slightly less common plantation.

Mud.

Buzzard, red kite, viaduct.

Mud.

And as we drive away I caught sight of at least 20 red-legged partridge inthe file next to the one they had been in previously.
