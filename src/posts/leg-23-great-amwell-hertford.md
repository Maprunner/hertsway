Leg 22 on Friday had been a day of water. And then it rained again. Setting out on Sunday morning the weather was cold but bright and forecast to be dry. Yet again we needed a detour on the way to the start. This time the road into Great Amwell from the A10 roundabout was blocked by flooding, with 50 metres of temporary lake visible to prove it. We did three laps of the roundabout whilst working out the next best route and eventually went one junction further south. Parking was along the side of the road at the entrance to Amwell Nature Reserve. This already had a lot of cars when we arrived and it would prove to be a busy day with lots of people out walking, running and cycling wherever we went.

Almost straight away we discovered the path along the New River blocked by a large fallen tree. This hadn't been there two days previously. We skirted round it and climbed up to the [church](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/great-amwell-church-hertfordshire.html) again. I had done my research this time and knew that the gravestone of [Harold Abrahams](https://www.olympic.org/harold-abrahams) was against the rounded wall of the early Norman apse. It turns out I was standing right next to it taking pictures last time we were here. Today it was adorned with a pile of pebbles balanced on top of it.

We dropped back down to the New River and after a muddy kilometre turned right and crossed the railway to get to the River Lee Navigation at Hardmead Lock. This brought us pretty quickly to Ware.Pleasant riverside housing estates gradually gave way to older industrial buildings and we were soon in the centre of the town. Tow more ringed mute swans swam by. 4EAF and 4CUW were two more locals, ringed very close to here two and three years ago.

A notice board by the river announced that we had reached ["The Gazebos the River Lea at Ware"](https://www.hertsmemories.org.uk/content/herts-history/places/rivers-and-canals/the-gazebos-of-ware) which are apparently "the largest group of gazebos on a riverside anywhere in Britain" although I'm not sure there's a great deal of competition for that title. They originate from 17th and 18th century attempts to make the riverside inns more attractive, but the remaining ten or so were rebuilt in the 1980s. Today they were glinting nicely in the sunshine and reflecting in the river.
