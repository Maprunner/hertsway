In a parallel universe today would have been the third time that Helen had organised the British Schools Orienteering Championships. [Cassiobury Park](https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#294), Watford, was in 1999 and we have four legs to go before we get there. [Wormley Woods](https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#56) was in 2010, and should have been today as well, and that will be another three or four legs later. Before we set off we both had to finish a few rounds of the [WOC99 Orienteering Unlocked](https://orienteeringunlocked.com/world-champs-1999/) event. This has been renamed from Lockdown Orienteering just in time for lockdown to start again. Helen spent quite a long time running virtually round Glen Afric in Catching Features, and I spent slightly less time doing the same, as well as navigating round a maze and trying to work out which blurry photo was the correct boulder in the Photo-O round. The [results system](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/lockdown-results/events/e009) is another Maprunner creation.

The weather forecast had looked awful for the weekend, but things gradually improved and it looked like later on Sunday might not be too bad. Catching Features filled enough time to allow the weather to clear a bit and it looked like we shouldn't get too wet so we decided to risk it. We needed a short diversion since what used to be the M10 was closed, so we ended up going the back way in to Hemel Hempstead. There was quite a lot of standing water on the roads, and we splashed through a big puddle at Water End. I mentally decided that the red kites we saw as we got to Great Gaddesden didn't count. Surprisingly I didn't see another one until just before Tring.

We parked by the school and set off up the first hill of the day towards the Buddhist monastery at the top of the ridge. The main building is somewhat obscured by hedges and building works. Turkey farm. Old road to Hudnall. Mud and puddles.

Big muddy field. No obvious path.

Cross road at Little Gaddesden. Start of woodland. Into Ashridge. Sign advertising diversion. Only 100m. 200 year old flint wall being rebuilt.

Matting in car park. Ashridge House. Across front of house. Around golf course.

View of monument.

Long straight muddy wet run. Cross road. Very busy on monument drive. Film caravans in square. Bright sunlight on monument. Ice cream van. Toilets. Highest point on Hertfordshire Way. At this point we were only about 50 metres from Buckinghamshire. The country boundary runs just to the north of Monument Drive and passes through the pond. The Visitor Centre is at about 220m above sea level. Very little of Hertfordshire is over 200 metres. Just this small area in Ashridge, and a slightly larger area south of Tring where the top of the ridge running round to Wendover Woods gets to a full 245m on the county boundary near Hastoe.

Steep path down to Aldbury. People carrying pints. Pub open by pond wit stocks. St Lawrence's Church. Views of monument above trees on ridge behind.

Ridgeway up to Ivinghoe Beacon. Tring station. Very large car park. No sign of Tring. West Coast Main Line. Red kites. Furthest west point.

Back up towards ridge along field edge. Views across towards Tring and highest point in Hertfordshire.

Cross gallops with plastic filling. Up hill. Not s many people. Started moving faster. Lots of mud and puddles. Cross road to Ashridge East. Needs remapping. Lots of brambles.

Snacks on edge of large open field. Soon on Frithsden Beeches map. Event in 1989. Gorse on wide ride. Along edge of ex golf course. Berkhamsted on hill off to right. [World War I troop training trenches](https://www.chilternsaonb.org/about-chilterns/chilterns-commons-project/history-project/berkhamsted-wwi-troop-training-trenches.html). Found control site. Then open, now mature trees.

Path turn right towards Berkhamsted. Longest section of Hertfordshire Way. Short side of triangle left to do. Up through golf course to War Memorial. Cross more golf course, down between houses to Frithsden Beeches. More controls.

Up other side to car park from event. Amazon parcels piled up at end of drive. Drop again between brick and flint walls with big bridge overhead. Church in Nettleden. Starts to rain so we put on coats but that cause it to stop. Looking back on climb out see more alpacas. Phone call from Peter to say that wheelbarrow wheels have arrived. Through back of Buddhist monastery. Back down same route to Great Gaddesden.
