In a parallel universe today would have been the third time that Helen had organised the British Schools Orienteering Championships. Cassiobury Park was in 1999 and we have four legs to go to get there. [Wormley Woods]() was in 2010, and should have been today as well, and that will be another three or four legs later.

But before we set off there were a few small things to finish Lockdown.

M10 closed.

Buddhist monastery. Turkey farm. Old road to Hudnall. Mud and puddles.

Big muddy field. No obvious path.

Cross road at Little Gaddesden. Start of woodland. Into Ashridge. Sign advertising diversion. Only 100m. 200 year old flint wall being rebuilt.

Matting in car park. Ashridge House. Across front of house. Around golf course.

Long straight muddy wet run. Cross road. Very busy on monument drive. Film caravans in square. Bright sunlight on monument. Ice cream van. Toilets. Highest point on Hertfordshire Way. 

Steep path down to Aldbury. People carrying pints. Pub open by pond wit stocks. St Lawrence's Church. Views of monument above trees on ridge behind.

Ridgeway up to Ivinghoe Beacon. Tring station. Very large car park. No sign of Tring. West Coast Main Line. Red kites.Furthest west point.

Back up towards ridge along field edge. Views across towards Tring and highest point in Hertfordshire. 

Cross gallops with plastic filling. Up hill. Not s many people. Started moving faster. Lots of mud and puddles. Cross road to Ashridge East. Needs remapping. Lots of brambles.

Snacks on edge of large open field. Soon on Frithsden Beeches map. Event in 1989. Gorse on wide ride. Along edge of ex golf course. Berkhamsted on hill off to right. [World War I troop training trenches](https://www.chilternsaonb.org/about-chilterns/chilterns-commons-project/history-project/berkhamsted-wwi-troop-training-trenches.html). Found control site. Then open, now mature trees. 

Path turn right towards Berkhamsted. Longest section of Hertfordshire Way. Short side of triangle left to do. Up through golf course to War Memorial. Cross more golf course, down between houses to Frithsden Beeches. More controls.

Up other side to car park from event. Amazon parcels piled up at end of drive. Drop again between brick and flint walls with big bridge overhead. Church in Nettleden. Starts to rain so we put on coats but that cause it to stop. Looking back on climb out see more alpacas. Phone call from Peter to say that wheelbarrow wheels have arrived. Through back of Buddhist monastery. Back down same route to Great Gaddesden.
