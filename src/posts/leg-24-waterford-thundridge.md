Helen spent the morning volunteering at a vaccine centre in St Albans so this ended up as an afternoon leg. There was still a light covering of snow from the weekend and the forecast didn't expect it to get above freezing, but there was quite a lot of blue sky and sunshine so we decided it was worth a go. Arriving at Waterford we got to see quite how big the area of laurel was between the road and the river and to wonder why anyone would plant it like that.

We crawled up the narrow road towards the railway bridge following an Asda delivery van that didn't seem too keen to get stuck. There was plenty of space in the car park at Waterford Heath Nature Reserve and we were soon on the way back down the hill to set off along Vicarage Lane. I optimistically suggested that this should be relatively sheltered from the cold easterly winds since we would be below the ridge along the river.

The route to Stapleford followed the Rive Beane north, crossing under the railway and then going through narrow strips of woodland. A church spire appeared above the trees and we ran through the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin to reach the road. Heading up the road I stopped to take a photo of the "Clusterbolts" road sign and said I thought we needed to go along it. There were no obvious signs but Helen checked the map and confirmed that we needed to stick to the main road for a while.

We climbed steadily out of Stapleford and then turned off the road just after overtaking a walker in a bright red jacket.The path went across a rough open area which was probably once a rubbish tip but was now covered in short grass, blackthorn bushes, ponds, ice, mud and sheep. The track at the far end went through a farmyard, past a veterinary practice and back to the road. Then it was more roads and fields as we set off towards Bengeo temple. A red kite flew over the trees. I took a photo of what I assumed were two pheasants in the distance which turned out to be hares when I got to look at the photo afterwards.

And then Helen said "Can I have the book please". We hadn't seen a sign for a long time. We were definitely following the route marked on the OS map. But something felt wrong. And indeed it was. The book showed that the Hertfordshire Way headed north out of Stapleford along Clusterbolts before doing a large loop round Woodhall Park and then turning back towards Bengeo Temple. We had nearly cut off this whole loop. We both knew we had to go back and do it properly, so we set off along the road back down to Stapleford. Checking afterwards my firs edition of teh Hertfordshire Way guidebook does have the route we followed. The OS map was newly bought last year but turns out to be "Revised 201 , reprinted with

That short detour had added well over two kilometres to the day, though it did produce the hares. We turned right along Clusterbolts and were soon back on the River Beane. A man in a red jacket was walking back towards us having found a much more efficient way of getting here. A single solar panel sat by the side of the path which turned out to be driving a pump for a water trough. And I then spent ages trying to get a photo of a white splodge in the reeds next to the river which I was initially convinced was a little egret but decided was in fact a plastic bag, But then when I looked at the photos afterwards it was indeed a little egret.
