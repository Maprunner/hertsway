Time for one last leg this year. Newgate Street was less foggy then when we were last here but still very cold. We set off down the long muddy path we had already done and found that it was now slightly less muddy, mainly because all the mud and puddles had frozen. Northaw Great Wood was still down there in the valley somewhere but we were left imagining it since there was still enough mist to keep it hidden.

We crossed a road and set off down the wonderfully named Cucumber Lane. The OS map shows a trig point here but there was no sign of it. Strangely we still haven't yet seen a trig point on this trip round Hertfordshire.

The route soon left the road and headed down the undulating Hornbeam Lane through a varied selection of fields and woodland. This was to be a theme for a day where the scenery seemed to be constantly changing. We had certainly left behind the huge open hedgeless fields of earlier legs.

Another theme for the day was big houses. The first one came complete with oversized Christmas decorations of the gate and a large livery stables next to it. We even saw a woman riding a horse in one of the dressage arenas which was a first. Business was obviously god at the stables since the next 400m of road was newly block paved and had a wide sandy strip down one side for those arriving by horse.

Crossing the road took us through a somewhat more run down farm with large dogs barking behind high hedges and fences. This part of Hertfordshire obviously a higher class of villain since the the police warning notices were targetted at "hare coursers and poachers" rather than the "criminals" on posters elsewhere. We were soon passing Harefield Wood but any hares were keeping well hidden or had been poached already.

There was now a strange loop around West End. We got within 10 metres of the path junction we needed but for some reason the Hertfordshire Way takes a one kilometre detour at this point. My guess would be that someone who was involved in defining the original route wanted to make sure that it went past their front door. But anyway, we got to see the delights of The Candlestick pub, a very nice cottage with its own Victorian postbox set in a flint wall, and two enormous houses.

One of these was still being built and was a large stone building. It obviously isn't going down well with the locals and the couple we talked to as we were passing said that it was known locally as the "Town Hall". The other enormous house came with an even more enormous garden complete with everything you would expect: topiary, rock garden, stone balustrade, lake, scattered statuary, small temple at bottom of garden.

Getting back to almost where we had been ten minutes earlier we turned left and headed down the edge of a field, across Essendon Brook and up into what the map shows as Backhouse Wood. A large fence ran alongside the path and at the top corner we found a notice saying this was a "United Nations Global Compact" project with "5 Year Wildlife and Woodland Restoration in Progress". This seemed odd but one photo was enough so I set off up hill. At that point James yelled quietly and I turned round to see James and Helen staring at something inside the fence.

What they were staring at was a white wallaby. I spent ages taking bad photos from a long distance trying not to disturb it. Eventually I just started to walk closer and soon got right up the fence. It just sat there and stared back at me. Then James spotted another one some way further back in the enclosure. Quite what they were doing inside a UN-sponsored fence in a Hertfordshire wood was not clear. It still isn't after some extensive Google searching. There does not appear to be a single mention of them anywhere we can find. Until I publish this of course.
