Today was March 21st. Census Day. World Down Syndrome Day. A year to the day since the British Orienteering Championships 2020 that weren't. 166 days since we set out from Royston on our tour around Hertfordshire. Five days since I got my first Covid vaccine. And time for our final leg.

We had worked out that doing this the normal way, starting from Barkway,running to Royston along the Hertfordshire Way and then back to Barkway by some other route was going to be a bit of an anti-climax. So instead we decided to reverse things so that we could get to Roy Stone and stop rather than face 10 kilometres back up hill. This meant a trip up the A1(M) for the first time since Leg 5, past many familiar sights from the early legs and then a chance to park on Therfield Heath as for Leg 1.

The heath was busy with people walking everywhere you looked, even though it was slightly overcast, slightly windy and lightly cold to be out. I had tried to select a route out of Royston that avoided the main roads and handily the orienteering map covered just enough of the houses estates on the south side of the town to allow us to pick our way through and across to the east.

We managed to jog to the top of the first short steep hill and had a brief stop to take in the views out across the heath and then round to the north and across into Cambridgeshire. Then it was straight back down into the next valley, up to the top of the next hill to a covered reservoir and then back down to cross Ermine Street, which at this point is the A10. A runner coming the other way warned that there was quite a strong wind to run into .

After a short section along the A10 past Royston Hospital we turned off around the edge of a housing estate and into some quite nice woodland. Helen was not convinced there would be a way across into the next estate but one turned up just as expected. We took the orienteer's route across the estate as I joined up a series of narrow alleyways and finally took a route between two long lines of garages and down some steps into yet another valley. We;d be back here two hours later since this was the Hertfordshire Way running down the valley and into Royston For now we scrambled up a grassy bank and ran through the next housing estate and along a road to finally get get to the start of the fields and out of Royston. new development of large black boarded barns.

Set off across field. At the edge of the field to the east was the cottage that I had found for sale when investigating houses in the area.

Through the gap in the hedge and we reached the start of the fenced paddocks of [Newsells Park stud](https://www.newsells-park.com/). This covers 1200 acres and is by far the biggest and most well-kept of the many horsey establishments we have run through. At the bottom of the valley was a large complex of buildings that would have been big on their own but were just the first of four or five such groups of buildings, all to the same design, that we would be running past. The fields were all fenced and labelled and had wide grassy strips between them. In theory the path was meant to go across several of them but there were signs up notifying of diversions and so we followed the new signs down between two fields at right angles to where we really wanted to be to find out where we would end up.

Paths diverted so not quite sure where we were going to end up.

Two young colts came across to say hello as we ran past the first building but we pressed on past small blocks of woodland and between yet more fenced fields in roughly the expected direction. Eventually we emerged at a road and crossed into another section of Newsells Park. From the bottom of the valley we climbed up past Fox Cottage to remind us that we still hadn't seen a fox. We passed the Newsells First World War memorial and then set off up a very muddy track towards the main house on the estate. A very large walled garden was partially hidden beyond the trees and then as we reached the top of the hill an obelisk appeared. This was erected in the late 19th Century by Field Marshal Lord Strathnairn in memory of a horse he had ridden in the Indian Mutiny.

By now we had got to the same height as the radio mast which was only 500 metres off to the west. The path emerged in Barkway past a new housing estate that hadn't made it onto the map yet, and we set off down the main road. This was lined with a whole sequence of old houses of a huge variety. We passed the war memorial at the road junction next to a very narrow half-timbered house. Then there was a chapel. A house with a large plaque showing the head of Paul Rubens. A mile stone giving distances to London, Ware and Cambridge.

We turned down Church Lane and arrived unsurprisingly at the church and the nominal start of today's last leg. Next to the gate was a pond with grassy banks leading down to each end which apparently suggest this used to be a cart wash. The churchyard had a convenient bench for a final snack. I investigated the gravestone and found the one for a doctor from the Crimean war. Peter chose this moment to ring and discuss things that he could do for World Down Syndrome Day.

And then it was time to set off again with the prospect of less than ten kilometres to go, most f which would be downhill. The first track was familiar but we soon reached the crossroads and could turn right to set off around the edge of the solar farm towards Reed. Narrow paths had been trodden through the newly ploughed fields and we soon reached [St Mary's church](https://hertfordshirechurches.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/st-mary-reed/).

From the church we turned back on ourselves and ran through the village towards the Back through village. Main road and start final climb up infield to top of hill.

Drop down to very large farm buildings. A large flock of chaffinches scattered as we approached and flew over to the the woodland on the other side of the path.

Large houses. View of Mile Post mill. Last stretch through stud farm.

Skateboarder. Helen put in a final effort and managed to run all the way up the final climb to the top of the ridge above Royston. And it was all downhill from there. Down through the woods past the large white cat thinking it was hiding in the bushes. Down the valley to the to the housing estate where we had crossed over earlier that morning. Down the road towards the centre of Royston. We eventually found the old police station and Magistrate's court which wasn't quite where the book suggested. And then it was across Priory Gardens. Holm oak. Scaffolding on church.

Royston cave. Roy stone.

Photos. Signpost.
