For some reason Helen had decided that it would be entertaining to run a leg in snow, and the weather forecast the day before showed that this might well be the case. As it turned out the snow didn't appear, but we got a light frost and thick fog instead and the temperature never got much above freezing all day.

The initially chosen parking spot in Potters Bar turned out to be a bit busy so we ended up with half a kilometre of road run at the start of the day but saved it from the end of the day. Once we'd finally made it off the road there was a muddy section through the woods (complete with old ladies and small dogs having trouble getting through the mud) before we got back to the familiar mud of the path leading out of Morven.

The scrubby open area lower down the path was obviously a frost hollow and the trees and bushes emerged from the fog covered with white frost. We waded through an extra deep section of mud to get back to where we had stopped on the previous leg and headed east through a series of large puddles just for a change.

The road section to Northaw was notable for the large puddle which we had to cross the road to get around, and then Northaw appeared through the fog. Helen set about reading the list of best kept small villages in Hertfordshire that adorns the [village sign](https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMB1RX_Village_Sign_Northaw_Herts_UK). The list runs from 1957 to 1999, which is when Northaw won. The sign was obviously erected then but it looks like it has not been touched since.

Somewhere in the fog behind the village green was St Thomas a Becket Church. When we got close enough to see it this turned out to be a lot newer than most churches we had been past so far and was also notable for not being built with flint.

It was now all downhill through the woods and fields south of the mansions that line the Ridgeway in Cuffley. Helen's phone went off at which point she realised she was meant to be in a Whatsapp meeting with friends but this rapidly got put back to the afternoon.

The birding interest for the leg all turned up at once with a large flock of redwings in the trees by the road, a kestrel perching on the power line and finally a flock of at least 21 red-legged partridge just about visible through the fog in the field just across the road.

Passing under the Hertford Loop railway we reached the junction of the Hertfordshire Way. We headed north towards Cuffley towards the end of Leg 9 and the start of Leg 10 according to the [official guidebook](https://www.fhw.org.uk/copy-of-guidebook-1). Leg 10 then goes from Cuffley to Hertford but has an alternative Leg 10A and 10B which start in Cuffley and loop round further to the east on the way to Hertford. We intend to do both routes to Hertford so we will be back in this muddy field at some point to set off east towards the Lea Valley.

Confusingly this means that this part of the route is both clockwise and anti-clockwise so we started seeing white signs with green text (the clockwise route for people doing the end of Leg 10A) as well as the green signs with white text that we are used to (the anticlockwise route for people doing the end of Leg 9). This only lasted a short while since we were soon in Cuffley. The route emerges onto the road at the Community Centre which had been the scene of the Hertfordshire Orienteering Club Christmas Social at almost exactly this time for the past two years but today it was firmly shut.

We pressed on past Cuffley station and then spent a long time on the road contouring around past a varied selection of large houses. The end of the road brought us to the entrance to the Scout Camp at Tolmers where we have all spent quite a lot of time on various scouting activities or when it is used as car parking for orienteering events on [Northaw Great Wood]().
