Today was another day of bright sunshine and blue skies, although the overnight frost was still visible on grass shaded from the sun. We parked in the carefully researched lay-by in Hadham Mill. A sign on the Nag's Head opposite us gave a date of 1595. Just along from the pub was a water pump dated 18 and a village sign, although for some reason this was for Little Hadham.

We set off across the River Ash on a footbridge and started to climb up through fields and woods towards Bury Green. The top of the hill turned out be a polo club with several large fat grassy fields and a rather run-down pavilion full of stacked white plastic chairs should polo ever start up again. A short debate at the road in in Bury Green confirmed we were where we wanted to be ad we set off past all of the nice houses we had seen last time to reach the path junction and pick up the Hertfordshire Way again.

After some pleasant woodland the path ran round the edge of one of the many very large fields that we would see today. A light scattering of small white pellets indicated that it had recently been fertilised. In the corner of the field we cam to the what you nee to fertilise fields this big: a trailer full of one-tonne fertilizer sacks. Each sack was roughly a metre cube, and helpfully marked "".

We go to the path crossing which marked the start of the loop into Bishop's Stortford. This caused quite a debate about which way round we should do it, not

Debate about which way to do loop.

Cross road, housing estate to Tesco. Avoid going into centre of Bishop's Stortford.

Photos on roundabout. Furthest east we will get. Road names.

Back through housing estate. Underpass flooded. "It will only be knee-deep" we both cried as Helen set off to test it. "It's cold" she said, somewhat predictably. She stopped when the water reached her thighs. I decided to go in to see if that was as deep as it got. It wasn't. I stopped when it reached my thighs as well. We still hadn't even got close to the underpass let alone get through it.

At this point we decided this was probably not a good idea. Luckily it looked like we could limb the bank an get up to cross the road. This did turn out to be feasible but required quite a lot of ducking through various thorn bushes and other unpleasant vegetation. We dived across the road in a suitable gap in the traffic and found a way into the far field and back to the path we wanted.

Green Street. Along narrow path past willow being harvested.

Back along other side of polo field, although they are quite big. Down towards A120.

Into Little Hadham. Loop around St Cecilia's church.

Path blocked by bypass construction so need to take detour.

Large light industrial estate including headquarters of the Essex Air Ambulance. Metal railings outside factory.

Along driveway. Views of bypass. Flock of 20 fieldfare.

Onto road and across construction site. Competition to see who could remember most of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. "Beware of the leopard".

Bypass not as finished as expected. Looked unlikely to open later this year.

Down off road across fields. River Ash completely dry at this point.

Upwick Hall. Post van delivering at Upwick Green. Dogs at next house run down drive to attack it.

Newly planted hedge in next field.

Distant views of kites circling. Pass Bogs Cottage.

Patmore Heath. Just like Nomansland Common.

Snacks sitting on handy bench next to car park for next leg.

Harcamlow Way towards Albury Hall. Strange names for woods. We pass Ypres. Munich ad Suez just beyond.

Back across fields to St Mary's church Albury.

More fields back towards bypass site office and new roundabout. A slow-moving excavator was holding up the traffic as it chugged back towards the site office. We dived across the road in front of it and set out across the final series of undulating fields back to Little Hadham. I spotted another horseshoe in the grass and that made it back to the car yo go with the one we collected on the first leg.
