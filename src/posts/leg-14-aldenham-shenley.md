Another early start on a cold but clear day. The trip to Aldenham took a bit longer than expected since Harper Lane was closed for road works at the railway bridge so we had to turn round, and there were three other sets of road works with traffic lights on the road into and out of Radlett. But we got there soon enough to be met by a red kite flying overhead.

The route away from the church wasn't as obvious as it might be which turned out to be a theme for the day. This was probably the leg with fewest signs at critical points so far. We finally found a way out on the corner of the churchyard and set off towards Letchmore Heath. A few fields later and we had made it.

The route through the village was two sides of a very narrow triangle so we ran all the way down the road to pond and War Memorial, only to double back on ourselves past a series of cottages of various ages and end up back pretty much where we started. The highlight was probably the man busy with a leaf blower rearranging the dead leaves as if he knew it would wind Helen up, which it did as it always does.

The it was more fields and woods and big houses before we got to the A5183, or Watling Street. Places that I had previously considered as being in Aldenham, such as Haberdashers' Aske's Boys. School](), Aldenham Country Park and the somewhat London Elstree Aerodrome, lay of to the south and turn out to be quite some way from the village of Aldenham.
