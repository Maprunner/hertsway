The forecast showed 45 mph winds on Saturday so we decided we had better things to, including the standard "not parkrun". This marked a year since my last parkrun: Ellenbrook Fields on [14 March 2020](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/ellenbrookfields/results/weeklyresults/?runSeqNumber=203). The forecast for Sunday still had 20 mph winds but looked promising enough. We made an early start but it was looking a bit gloomy as we approached Hare Street. There were red kites on ground in field in Hare Street just like last week. There had been much debate about possible parking places but in the end we found a space near the the road junction which was exactly what we needed.

The first road up the hill was quite steep and Helen was puffing by the time we got to the top. I did an extra 20 metres to get a photo to prove that we really were starting at The Old Cesspit and then it was across a field back down to the road. We came out just past where we had left the car ten minutes before. The road through the village was lined with the normal assortment of large houses including Dane House. Helen was at university with someone who lived there forty years ago.

Past Hormead Hall and set out into large fields that will be typical of rest of the day. Two long line of pylons running into the distance towards St Ippolyts near Little Wymondley were we had crossed them on Leg 4.

North towards Anstey. Two dog walkers.

First sightings of primroses. Lots of young trees planted along bottom of valley.

Up road to [St George's church](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/anstey-church-hertfordshire.html). The entrance was through a mediaeval tripartite lych gate. and through churchyard. Very large island in middle of moat behind Anstey Hall. Old stables converted to houses forming edge of churchyard. Primroses and crocuses.

Along road through village. Anstey Hall next to church. Road junction with water pump in wooden shelter. Blind Fiddler pub. Anstey Chapel.

The final terraced row of cottages along the road were all painted in slightly different shades of white much to Helen's annoyance. We turned onto a path and started heading around the edge of Scales Park wood. This is quite large and looked surprisingly runnable although flat and featureless. We had now reached what used to be the main runway of Nuthampstead airfield. This was a USAAF airfield built in 1942 and was home to P-38 Lightning fighters and then B-17 bombers. After the airfield closed on 1959 much of the concrete was broken up and used as hardcore for the M1. The line of the runway is now marked by a plantation of quite large mature pine trees.

We ran along a remaining taxiway parallel to the trees and a familiar object soon appeared. This was our third VOR after Bovingdon on [Leg 11](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/hertsway/post/leg-11-berkhamsted-common-to-bovingdon/) and Brookmans Park on [Leg 18](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/hertsway/post/leg-18-newgate-street-to-bayford/)). Just as Brookmans Park VOR is in fact just outside Bayford so this was Barkway VOR just outside Nuthampstead. There were old airfield buildings in the distance and beyond them was a strange bright green hill. We couldn't decide if this was a planted field or a roof on an enormous barn. Helen eventually got out the binoculars and decided it was a green tarpaulin over a big earth bank.The map shows this was Nuthampstead Shooting Ground.

The path headed left away from the airfield and towards [Nuthampstead airfield museum](https://www.nuthampsteadairfieldmuseum.com/) and The Woodman Inn. The pub is marked by an axe on top of the thatched roof. On the edge of the car park are two memorials.

Bull Farm. Weather vane. Warnings on gates. Bull in barn.

Around woods. Lots of deer tracks, Gaps in hedge to let the through.

Down final fields to Rushingwells. Two Teslas parked in drive. Long potholed track.

Reach main road in Barkway. Another selection of old houses like Much Hadham and Hare Street.

Duck warning sign. Pond with village sign and views of church tower.

[St Mary Magdalene church](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/barkway-church-hertfordshire.html), Barkway.

Out along Hertfordshire Way. Crossroads. Straight on. Solar farm. Horses on path.Stop for snacks.

Closer look at solar farm. Pheasant flew out.

View of radio mast beyond Barkway that we had been heading for all day.
Distant views of Reed church which we will visit on the final leg. Another large mast behind it which marks where the Hertfordshire Way heads down towards Royston.

Distant views of [St Andrew's church](https://hertfordshirechurches.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/st-andrew-buckland/), Buckland. Appears to have bricked up window in tower.

Large ploughed fields. No hedges. Wide open views. Very large hay stack on skyline that we eventually reached and ran past. Eight bales high.

Another ploughed field with a signpost but no obvious path. We check the map and decide that we need to be heading straight at the pylon on the skyline. At that point I spotted a large herd of deer jut below the skyline. As I was trying to get a first photograph I spotted two small brown shapes disappearing off across the field to the right. These were two hares who sprinted off until well out of sight.

The herd looked strangely familiar. It was about the same size as the one from the previous leg(I counted 111 in the photos this time), and had about the same number of white deer. But as we got a bit closer we could see several more sets of antlers than last week, including a white deer with antlers So this certainly wasn't exactly the same herd.

The footpath signs started having a new "GMT" marker on them which turns out to be the [Greenwich Meridian Trail](https://www.greenwichmeridiantrail.co.uk/).

Wyddial Hall.Large cedar tree in the middle of parkland. Moat by farm buildings.

[St Giles church](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/wyddial-church-hertfordshire.html), Wyddial.

House with statuary in garden. Enormous fountain, elephant, mouse.

[Greenwich Meridian marker](http://www.thegreenwichmeridian.org/tgm/location.php?i_latitude=51.966902&i_type=%7C%20Telescope%20%7C) on verge by side of road, plus oak tree and plaque.

Across more ploughed fields. Under pylon lines again.

Cross road. Final crossing of the mighty River Quin. The odd puddle in the bottom.

No path across ploughed field. Decide t stick to the grassy strip round the edge. Final hill of the day up and around a small wooded area. The final red kites of the day flew overhead. Later investigation showed that this used to be the site of two windmills, but there was no real sign of them left.

Down hill through houses and back to road right next to the car. One leg to go.
