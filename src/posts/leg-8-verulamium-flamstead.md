Work in progress...

Today should have been the Hertfordshire Orienteering Club Saturday Serie event at Stanborough Park but the second lockdown ended that. This had allowed us to pick the better weather forecast and set out on Saturday rather than Sunday. The short trip to Verulamium was made only slightly longer by having to go via a friend's house to deliver some rhubarb crowns that Helen had dug up from the allotment, but we still ended up parking at St Michael's just before 9.00. The church clock striking nine is the signal to start the parkrun here, and two or three people did just that, rather than the three or four hundred that turn up in normal times. We set off in the opposite direction with slightly more than five kilometres ahead of us.

The permissive road through Gorhambury Estate had finally decided it needed to shut in honour of lockdown so the first two kilometres had to be along the Redbourn Road rather than along what used to be Watling Street. Almost the first thing we saw was a heron in the fields by the Prae Wood Arms. We soon reached the gate into Gorhambury that we should have been coming out of, complete with a notice explaining why it was closed, and then we could turn right off the main road and start the section along the River Ver itself.

Through the old mill and the neat farmyard and it was time for a photo stop to capture the reflections in the pond. The path ran through scrubby bushes parallel to the River Ver over to the left and we were making steady progress when suddenly there was an extremely loud call of "chetty" from an unseen bird in the tree just above us. We both stopped and scanned the bushes trying to find it, but we never managed to see it. It had flown a little further away but continued to sing it's definitive song, and there was no doubt this was a Cetti's warbler. This is a bird that I had never seen or even heard before, but knew was a possibility along this stretch as it features frequently in the [Herts Bird Club reports](https://www.hnhs.org/herts-bird-club/home). It's call is an unmistakable "chetty chetty chetty" . Latin name Cettia Cetti, family Cettidae. It seems somewhat fortuitous that 18th century Italian zoologist [Francesco Cetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Cetti) was available to name it after. Don't expect a photo, but apparently it's another of those little brown non-descript ones.

The path continued on and crossed the Ver on a footbridge by a farmyard. We stopped to watch two large farm vehicles ploughing through the quite deep water in the ford next to the bridge. We were now at Redbournbury Mill which seemed hopeful of some passing trade since there were stalls open with people selling bread. The inevitable red kite flew over and soon we had reached Redbourn. We followed the [Nickey Line](http://www.nickeyline.org/) around the edge of the village. This is the former Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead Railway, which was closed in 1979 and is now a footpath and cycleway. This is part of [National Cycle Route 57](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-57/) running from Welwyn Garden City all the way to Gloucestershire. We'd already run another part of it coming in to Wheathampstead on [Leg 6](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/hertsway/post/leg-6-lamer-park-to-sandridge/).

After a short section along the NickeY Line the signs led us down a narrow path between houses and into the [Church of St Mary](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/redbourn-church-hertfordshire.html). I managed the normal selection of photographs but struggled to get what I felt would have been an interesting alignment of the weather vane and the moon. Unfortunately someone had planted an avenue of lime trees without thinking of future photographic opportunities and there was a tree right where I needed to stand to get things lined up properly. Can't get moon to line up with spire. Press on rather than turn back.

The path out of the churchyard followed the edge of Redbourn through fields and the we climbed up to a bridge across the M1 and into the large complex of buildings at Flamsteadbury Farm. This included a field full of solar panels and a wind turbine, along with an [indoor cricket centre](http://www.cricketfirstchoice.co.uk/). Beyond the farm the track entered a huge field and we could it all the way to the far side, well over a kilometre away. It was busy with walkers, and skylarks sang loudly as we progressed.

Badger set in woods. Out into large valley. Trowley Bottom. Up to Flamstead. Crocheted village sign.

[St Leonard's Church](https://hertfordshirechurches.weebly.com/flamstead-church-hertfordshire.html) at top of hill. Lots of old buildings around it. And that was the end of the Hertfordshire Way for today. The route back was along Chiltern Way, or at least it was after a short detour down a dead end road. Emerge into pop-up pumpkin farm. Two more red kites.

Out onto Junction 9 of M1. No real path. Through teasels along edge. Showground to right. Turn left up very overgrown path. River Ver at bottom.Electric fence around edge of field. Cows in distance.

Two buzzards fly over. Stonechat on bush and flying around. Discussion with woman from Harpenden.

Through farmyard past confused builders. More electric fences. Follow Ver.

[Friars Wash](https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/our-work/friars-wash-redbourn)

Stop by river for snacks.

Redbourn Golf Course. Closed.

Up hill past riding school. Open. Child riding bike down hill. Crossed the Nickey Line again. [Rothamsted](https://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#275). Lots of people out walking.

Down drive. Lots of cars parked along road. Through large posh houses. Crossing the Harpenden Road we entered the golf course on Harpenden Common. Again this was empty of golfers but busy with walkers. We crossed the cricket pitch which is cunningly positioned in the middle of one of the fairways and left to the golf course to enter fields looking back over the railway to Heartwood Forest. By now we were both just keen for it to be finished, especially since we were now repeating bits from Leg 7. We found a new way through Childwickbury taking uis thjrough teh fruit farm. Strawberries, blackberries,raspberries, currants.

Man cutting grass. Batchwood. White dog in mud. Cross golf course. Another repeat stretch.

Down past Kingsbury Water Mill. Pudding stone.

Back to Verulamium.
