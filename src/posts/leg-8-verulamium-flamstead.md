Work in progress...

Today should have been the Hertfordshire Orienteering Club Saturday Serie event at Stanborough Lakes, but the second lockdown ended that. That allowed us to pick the better weather forecast and set out on Saturday rather than Sunday. The short trip to Verulamium was made only slightly longer by having to go via a friend's house to deliver some rhubarb crowns that Helen had dug up from the allotment, but we still ended up parking at St Michael's just before 9.00. The church clock striking nine is the signal to start the parkrun here, and two or three people did just that, rather than the three or four hundred that turn up in normal times. We set off in the opposite direction with a long leg ahead of us.

The permissive road through Gorhambury Estate had finally decided it needed to shut in honour of lockdown so the first two kilometres had to be along the Redbourn Road rather than along what used to be Watling Street. Almost the first thing we saw was a heron in the fields by the river. We soon reached the gate into Gorhambury that we should have been coming out of, complete with a notice explaining why it was closed, and then we could turn right off of the main road and start the section along the River Ver itself.

Through the old mill and the neat farmyard and it was time for a photo stop to capture the reflections in the pond. The path ran through scrubby bushes parallel to the River Ver over to the left and we were making steady progress when suddenly there was an extremely loud call of "chetty" from an unseen bird in the tree just above us. We both stopped and scanned the bushes trying to find it, but we never managed to see it. It had flown a little further away but continued to sing it's definitive song, and there was no doubt this was a Cetti's warbler. This is a bird that I had never seen or even heard before, but knew was a possibility along this stretch as it features frequently in the [Herts Bird Club reports](https://www.hnhs.org/herts-bird-club/home). It's call is an unmistakeable "Chetty chetty chetty" . Latin name Cettia Cetti. It was somewhat fortuitous that there was a Mr Cetti to name it after. Don't expect a photo, but it's a little brown non-descript one.
