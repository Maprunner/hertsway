After a short trip up the M1 we were quickly parking next to Flamstead church ready to set off. The church had changed since we were there four days earlier and was now fenced off behind metal mesh fencing and had acquired two portaloos and quite a lot of signage indicating that repairs were about to start and that lottery money was involved.

Turning left out of the village we started off down "Friendless Lane". On paper this was a leg that didn't really seem to have anything of particular interest ahead. But inevitably something would turn up, and the first thing was red kite number one. I resolved to count them, but gave up when they started turning up five or six at a time later on.

The path to Markyate took the direct route straight across a large ploughed field with quite a large valley in it as well. Skylarks sang as we splashed through the mud and we were soon passing the allotments on the edge of the village before coming out on the road. The route went down to the main road and almost straight away headed back up the hill. At least we could claim we had done a lap of the fire station, but it did seem a bit unnecessary. We didn't get to see the church, which Helen knew was well outside the centre since it is next to the Scout Hut. The remainder of the day was full of her pointing out places where she had started or finished D of E Expeditions or lost groups on the way. 

There was a depressing reminder that Christmas was coming in Markyate with one house already having a front garden full of decorations and lights, but the housing soon ended and we headed off into the farmland that was going to dominate the rest of the leg. We ran around the edge of a lot of fields, past a lot of sheep and horses, and had soon ticked off a ring-necked parakeet (strangely absent from the leg around St Albans where we are normally overrun by them) as well as three alpacas behind a hedge that Hlen wasn't quite tall enough to see over.

Park and Ride. Big estate. Sheep in field. Many red kites and pheasants.

Gaddesden Row. Guide Hut. School in middle of nowhere.

Colours. Balancing fallen tree. Just for a change two buzzards circled over the trees off to the left.

Black sheep. Alpacas.

Coming out of the wood we finally got a glimpse of the spire of Flamstead Church on the horizon. All that was left was to run around a few more fields, down a really muddy path Cross Trowley Bottom, Very muddy again.

We decided to opt for the Redbourn Road rather than the M1 to get home. This meant I could spot what I assume is the intended route for the Chiltern Way under Junction 9 which we had missed although it still looked a bit of an afterthought.  The road took us past many of the sights from the previous leg, and a little egret was standing in the River Ver exactly where we crossed the road on Saturday.
