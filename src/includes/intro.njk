    Helen and Simon Errington decided to run the Hertfordshire Way as something to get them through Covid. We started in Royston on Wednesday October 7th 2020. Drive to the start, run in an anti-clockwise direction along the Hertfordshire Way for an hour or two, run back to the car along whatever convenient route is available. Repeat as necessary until Royston appears again, which it did on Sunday March 21st 2021. This is the story of their travels.
