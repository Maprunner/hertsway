    Helen and Simon Errington are running the Hertfordshire Way. We started in Royston on Wednesday October 7th 2020. Drive to the start, run in an anti-clockwise direction along the Hertfordshire Way for an hour or two, run back to the car along whatever convenient route is available. Repeat as necessary until Royston appears again. This is the story so far.
